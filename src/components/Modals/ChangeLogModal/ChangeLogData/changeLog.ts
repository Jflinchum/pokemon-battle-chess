#### Hello and thank you for checking out Pok√©mon Gambit!
This game is currently being actively worked on, so please bear with me if things seem slightly unstable.

##### Change log for v1.0.0
- Added a Change Log button on the main menu to display the latest patch notes.
- Adjusted the disconnect timer to kick users out of the room after 5 minutes of disconnection (previously 1 minute).
  - This should allow you all to attempt to re-join the same room and save your ongoing game if any errors occur that kick you out.
- Added an option to enable Chess premoves in the game settings.
  - Previously, this was always enabled with no option to disable it.
