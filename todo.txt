Matchmaking
Host controls
  - Set player color
  - Update settings
  - Kick player
  - Promote to host
  - Return to room in-game
Pre-move chess pieces
Queue up your draft and bans
Break out the draft into phases

Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Move pokemon engine to server
  - Blocks game timer features below
  - Ban timer and random ban if failing the timer
    - In order to keep server and client synced on the timer, set a UTC expiration time and send that to the client?
- Host controls
- More detailed modals in game
  - Add server disconnect
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling (for now)
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Issues:
- Need to reset move history on reset room
- Form submissions
- Pawn promotion form should go away after choosing
- Show pokemon level on details screen
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- Joining a room should clear viewing results status
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Style issues:
- (Potentially fixed) Disable dark mode from browser settting
- Scale the chessboard based on height as well as width

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
