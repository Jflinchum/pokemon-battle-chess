TODO:
Matchmaking
Host controls
  - Set player color
  - Update settings
  - Kick player
  - Promote to host
  - Return to room in-game
Queue up your draft and bans
Add forfeit button to pokemon battle
Create formats to quick select game options in room
Turn timer into second:millisecond timer once down below a minute left
Write validation functions when writing/reading from localstorage and clear it out if failing validation

Keyboard navigation and accessibility

Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Queueing up Drafts/Chess moves
  - Queue up drafts but not bans? Bans seem tough to convey queues with
  - Chess moves
    - Clear queue if most recent move of your color failed
- Host controls
  - Redesign player list first, both in room and in game
- Better logging
- Curate pokemon sets
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- More detailed modals in game
  - Add server disconnect
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling (for now)
- (better) Error boundary

Refactor TODOs:
- Potentially lift game logic into new model
- Put API request and response types in shared folder
- Organize frontend types in a single dir and re-use more efficiently

Issues:
- Room not resetting fully when rematching sometimes
- Resyncing right after a battle while fast forwarding
  - This issue seems to come and go. Needs more investigation
- Premoving should still cost .1 seconds, at a minimum
- Pawn promotion form should go away after choosing
- Disallow client controls when the match ends
- Bigger turn indicator maybe by player details
  - Better indicator that time is ticking down in timer mode
- Player disconnecting removes player nameplate in game
- Pokemon details looks weird on mobile when pokemon only has one move (ditto)
- Joining a room should clear viewing results status
- Some pokemon do not appear in image for background
- Room options being user friendly (timer should be a dropdown of options, any required input should prevent form submission)
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg
- Better scaling for smaller screen sizes
- Wrap pokemon statuses

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
- Break out the draft into multiple phases (i.e pawns, bishops&knights, rooks, queen&king)
  - Could potentially be interesting as an option, but seems like it makes it a little too complicated for not much gain in regards to strategy
