Battle Timers
Text Speed on pokemon battles
Matchmaking
Host controls
  - Set player color
  - Update settings
  - Kick player
  - Promote to host
Pre-move chess pieces
Rejoining a game in progress
  - Would have to track history of game and send it back to client
  - Could also store state of game clientside?
    - Current board state
    - Current pokemon battle state
      - ^ May be tricky. Could do history of commands for this one
Battle Animation when pieces attack

Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Open and closed team sheets
 - Draft & Ban
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Battle Animation between pieces when a battle is beginning and ending
- Host controls
- Better Room Options explanations/formatting
- Draft & Ban
- Rejoining
- Clear out room if all players transient
- Social media meta tags
- Fun background and logo?

Issues:
- Clarity on who's turn it is
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes
