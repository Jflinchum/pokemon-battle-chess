 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- width/height of chess square percentage based. Min-width/min-height of board based on vw/vh
- Ban timer and random ban if failing the timer
- Host controls
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling (for now)
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Issues:
- Need to reset move history on reset room
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- Joining a room should clear viewing results status
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Style issues:
- (Potentially fixed) Disable dark mode from browser settting
- Scale the chessboard based on height as well as width

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
