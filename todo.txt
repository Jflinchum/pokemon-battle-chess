Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Queueing up Drafts/Chess moves
- Battle/animation speed
  - Necessary for battle timer
- Host controls
- More detailed modals in game
  - Add server disconnect
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling (for now)
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Refactor TODOs:
- Potentially lift game logic into new model
- Put API request and response types in shared folder
- Organize frontend types in a single dir and re-use more efficiently

Issues:
- Form submissions
- Resyncing right after a battle while fast forwarding
  - This issue seems to come and go. Needs more investigation
- Pawn promotion form should go away after choosing
- Disallow client controls when the match ends
- Bigger turn indicator maybe by player details
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- Joining a room should clear viewing results status
- Some pokemon do not appear in image for background
- Room options being user friendly (timer should be a dropdown of options, any required input should prevent form submission)
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg
- Better scaling for smaller screen sizes

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
- Break out the draft into multiple phases (i.e pawns, bishops&knights, rooks, queen&king)
  - Could potentially be interesting as an option, but seems like it makes it a little too complicated for not much gain in regards to strategy
