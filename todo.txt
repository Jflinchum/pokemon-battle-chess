 - Custom Teams
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Chat room works between multiple rooms
  - Global chat?
- Ban timer and random ban if failing the timer
- Host controls
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Issues:
- Need to reset move history on reset room
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Style issues:
- (Potentially fixed) Disable dark mode from browser settting
- Scale the chessboard based on height as well as width

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes
