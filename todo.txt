TODO:
Matchmaking
Queue up your draft and bans
  - Queue up drafts but not bans? Bans seem tough to convey queues with
  - Drafts
    - Instead of merging the board state within BattleChessManager, 
      store state of current drafted pieces and merge the board state
      within draft manager
    - Store a queue of drafts within draft manager that you can the dequeue
      when it is the player's turn to draft
      - Be careful of index shifting. Pokemon are unique, so we could store the species.
        However it may be nicer to shift the index of the queue when a pokemon is drafted
Create formats to quick select game options in room
Write validation functions when writing/reading from localstorage and clear it out if failing validation
Download/upload replay
  - Store current user info as a spectator
  - Offer "Download Replay" button on Error Boundary if player was in game?
    - On error, would need to set the match history in state somewhere. Maybe some sort of error context?
Add more music and make music playlist w/ skip track button
Pokemon Cries
Profanity filter on names and chat
Keyboard navigation and accessibility
Battle conclusion animation? Needs to be a little short and skippable for bullet chess
Add Pokedex on left nav to look up full descriptions?

Room Options
- Preserve damage after battle
- Tera enabled
  - A Pokemon can only tera once in a match, and then they can't tera again
- Set player colors before starting
- Closed Team Sheets
- Custom Teams
- (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
- (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
- (maybe) Level Up Progression
  - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Better logging
  - Use winston + prometheus + grafana?
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- More detailed modals in game
  - Are you sure you want to leave? modal when returning to menu in game
  - Add server disconnect
- (better) Error boundary

Refactor TODOs:
- Potentially lift game logic into new model
- Lift weather out of pokemon manager
- Move z index to variables at root
- Put API request and response types in shared folder
- Organize frontend types in a single dir and re-use more efficiently
- Separate out draft/ban calls
- Move logic in controller/index into GameRoom
- Remove key from chessmanager since it's a hack to re-render pokemon after drafting

Issues:
- Weather from weather squares says "5 or 8 turns" when it's always 5
- Draft picking timer does not reset exactly to max time. It goes as little above or below it
- Terrain/weather clearing should clear square modifier
- Weather square info on detail card does not show up during drafting
- Wrong music playing after skipping to current turn when catching up
- Skipping to current turn while battle is about to start leads to a blank screen
- Premoves:
  - Occasionally clearing when it shouldn't
  - Does not clear if opponent piece moves to premove spot (triggers battle)
- Disallow server inputs when match has ended
- Pokemon sprites occasionally disappearing
  - Caching issue? Clearing cache and refreshing fixes it, and it doesn't happen on all clients
- On reconnect, server should check if the game is on going and tell the client the room is closed if it isn't
  - Can test on mobile by turning off the screen and waiting for timeout to occur
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
- Break out the draft into multiple phases (i.e pawns, bishops&knights, rooks, queen&king)
  - Could potentially be interesting as an option, but seems like it makes it a little too complicated for not much gain in regards to strategy
