TODO:
Text Speed on pokemon battles
Matchmaking
Host controls
  - Set player color
  - Update settings
  - Kick player
  - Promote to host
Pre-move chess pieces
Queue up your draft and bans
Break out the draft into phases

Game Name Ideas:
- Pokemon Chess Arena
- Pokemon Gambit
- Pokemon Chess Gambit
Keyboard navigation and accessibility

Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Resyncing right after a battle while fast forwarding
- Battle/animation speed
  - Necessary for battle timer
- Host controls
- More detailed modals in game
  - Add reasoning for game loss (time out, king taken, etc.)
  - Add host leaving causing game end
  - Add player 1 leaving causing game end
  - Add player 2 leaving causing game end
  - Add server disconnect
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling (for now)
- Toast notifications for errors and such
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Refactor TODOs:
- Potentially lift game logic into new model
- Put API request and response types in shared folder
- Organize frontend types in a single dir and re-use more efficiently

Issues:
- Form submissions
- Pawn promotion form should go away after choosing
- Show pokemon level on details screen
- Disallow client controls when the match ends
- Bigger turn indicator maybe by player details
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- Joining a room should clear viewing results status
- Some pokemon do not appear in image for background
- Room options being user friendly (timer should be a dropdown of options, any required input should prevent form submission)
- Chat rooms work between multiple rooms
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Style issues:
- (Potentially fixed) Disable dark mode from browser settting
- Scale the chessboard based on height as well as width

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes

Dropping features:
- Global Chat
  - Don't want to moderate
  - Increases the websocket connections => more servers
  - Discord exists, people can make that
