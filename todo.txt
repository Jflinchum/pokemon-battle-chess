Pre-move chess pieces

Disable support pokemon from team generation
Room Options
 - Preserve damage after battle
 - (maybe) Preserve item usage after battle
 - Custom Teams
 - Weather on random chess spaces
 - Checkmate isn't the win condition, taking the king is
    - Patch chess.js to include function to ignore check
 - (maybe) Change pokemon on piece promotion
 - Level Up Progression
    - piece starts out weak, but gains levels/evolutions as you beat other pieces

Priority:
- Show ability/item descriptions on hover
- Ban timer and random ban if failing the timer
- Show whether chess move succeeded or failed in move history
- Chat room works between multiple rooms
  - Global chat?
- Host controls
- Robots.txt disable search engine crawling
- Curate pokemon sets
- (better) Error boundary

Issues:
- Player disconnecting at end game modal clears their name
- OG/Twitter meta tags do not support svg

Style issues:
- (Potentially fixed) Disable dark mode from browser settting
- Scale the chessboard based on height as well as width

Filter out moves:
- Sticky webs
- Stealth rocks
- Spikes
- Toxic Spikes
